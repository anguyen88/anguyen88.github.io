		<p><a href="http://www.forgeconf.com/" target="_blank">Forge Conference</a> is Philadelphia's Premier UX &amp; Product Design Conference. The goal for the 2016 website was to evolve the brand further from the previous 2 years while maintaining consistant brand elements throughout.</p>
		<p>We loved the blue and orange colors that have been used throughout the years and wanted to find ways to have the colors mix and interact with each other. The 2016 landing page was also a huge inspiration for the team. We wanted to expand the shapes used from triangles to more organic overlaid shapes. This gave us a lot of opportunity to work in larger shapes to sit behind, and house content.</p>
