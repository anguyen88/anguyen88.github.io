		<h3 id="my-journey-to-finding-self-confidence-and-becoming-a-proud-first-generation-asian-in-america">My journey to finding self-confidence and becoming a proud first generation Asian in America</h3>

<p>I was born and raised in rural Lancaster, Pennsylvania and attended Conestoga Valley High School. Out of the current 4,500 students, 5.8% of them are Asian. Having graduated from there in 2007, it felt like it was so much less than 5%.</p>

<p>I was one of the few Asian students, but it was always relatively easy going. No, I never got picked on for eating weird foods, or for not being able to pronounce girl and world correctly because I couldn’t get my head around the damn rl sound.</p>

<p>The struggle I had with my own identity and my lack of confidence was always self-imposed.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Is this food that my mom packed for me weird? Does it smell strange, are people going to give me funny looks for eating it? Maybe I’ll sit by myself so no one has to ask me questions about it.</em></li>
  <li><em>Oh no, my turn to read is coming up and the paragraph has the word pearl, should I skip over it or hope no one notices that I say pearwl?</em></li>
  <li><em>Are kids not hanging out with me anymore since I work hard and do well in my classes? They must think I’m a teacher’s pet.</em></li>
  <li><em>If I have friends over are they going to find the stuff in the fridge strange? Should I hide stuff when they come over?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Trying to fit in with the rest of the kids helped me cope and sometimes allowed me to forget for a few brief moments that I was Asian. I was just another person in the crowd, I wasn’t different.</p>

<p>“Oh man, I completely bombed that test. I totally should have studied,” became a normal thing to say as I would crumble up the test to hide the A that was written at the top of the page. I would purposely “forget” certain math equations in games of Around the world so that I wouldn’t win. I would pretend that I didn’t understand basic addition and subtraction when called on in class, when really I was easily solving long division problems in second grade.</p>

<p>Why fall into the stereotype of the hard working Asian? I just wanted to be average.</p>

<p>To this day there are still moments where I still have trouble with self identity. Trouble with figuring out where I belong as a first-generation Asian male in America. The scale of privilege has been the most confusing topic for me to figure out Where do I belong, do I have more inherent privilege compared to other minorities? (But that’s a discussion for another time.)</p>

<p>I’ve gotten better. I’m much more comfortable and I’ve become more confident in myself and my decisions. I wish there was a broad solution that would allow others who feel this way to magically feel better about themselves overnight, but there is never a one size fits all answer.</p>

<p>I just wake up every day and remind myself that I am who I am, and I shouldn’t have to pretend to be someone different. I’ve surrounded myself with loving people who push me to do my best in everything I do, and with every success comes a little more confidence that I store and build upon.</p>

<p>Around college I started to call my parents more often, something about being away from them and not seeing them often never felt right. This is something I do still today, every morning I call my father on my way to work. (I’d call my mom too, but I know better than to wake her up.) Something about hearing the happiness in their voices, and hearing the pride they had that one of their children is in college helped something click. I realized that I should be the absolute best me that I can be, I should stand proud and put my best effort into every single thing I do, because my parents made a sacrifice early on to give my siblings and I opportunities that they never had in Vietnam.
Call your parents often if you’re able to. It goes a long way and can help you slowly realize things about yourself that you never have.</p>

<p>I started this post wanting to write little notes to my past self like…</p>

<ul>
  <li>First grade Tony, don’t get embarrassed about having rice with soy sauce and eggs for lunch, it’s a damn good combo.</li>
  <li>Third grade Tony, the rl sound really is hard when it is rarely used in the first language you learned and primarily spoke at home.</li>
  <li>High school Tony, working hard and studying helped shape you into the person you are today, giving you the opportunity to write this, and to work within a field that you love with some truly amazing people.</li>
</ul>

<p>But I guess more than anything, this was therapeutic for me and a way to remind myself that those negative feelings only last as long as I allow them to. I need to just remember to be proud of who I am.</p>

<p>And really, you should too.</p>

<p class="smaller">Edit — After speaking to the wonderful Upma Singh, I’ve come to realize that really I’m a second-generation American. Calling myself first-generation would deny my parents the American-hood that they sacrificed so much for. So thank you Upma, so so much, for opening my eyes to something I never noticed before.</p>
