		<p>One of the big goals that I had for 2015 was to refine the way that I was showing prototypes. I originally started by just building rough HTML/CSS prototypes, but they proved ineffective in conveying the movement and animations that I wanted. I quickly moved to Keynote, and using magic move I was able to start getting across the types of movement and animations that I wanted. Currently I'm using <a href="http://principleformac.com/" target="_blank">Principle</a> to create the animations that I've needed. I love the ability to time out animations but also create free prototypes that I can use the mouse to control.</p>
