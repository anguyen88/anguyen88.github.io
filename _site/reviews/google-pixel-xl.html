				<p><sub>Full disclosure: I’ve used The Samsung Galaxy S2 &amp; S3, iPhone edge, iPhone 4 – iPhone 6S, Nexus 5, Nexus 6P. Daily driver currently is the Google Pixel XL for personal use and the iPhone 6S for work.</sub></p>

<h2 id="overall">Overall</h2>
<p>Oh the Pixel. I was perfectly okay with skipping out on this generation of Google’s phone. The Nexus 6P covered everything I needed in a phone and a bit more. But after spending roughly a month with the Pixel, the quality of life changes it brings absolutely puts every other Android phone that I’ve ever owned or tested to shame.</p>

<p>Not all is good though, I have to say the two biggest problems I have with this phone are price point, and the bland uninspired design. The Pixel 32GB starts at $649.00, Pixel XL 32GB starts at $769.00. For a phone that starts at this price you would expect a few features that have become somewhat standard in competitor devices. Water proof, wireless charging, expandable storage. Design wise, you wouldn’t be wrong to say it looks exactly like an iPhone. The only difference is the glass panel on the back and the fingerprint sensor.</p>

<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>
<p>I tend to laugh every time a keynote speaker says “this is our best, fastest phone yet.” Obviously it’s going to be better than last generation right? Let’s take a second and run through the tech jargon. The Pixel XL houses a <em>1.6GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 821</em>, <em>4GB of RAM</em>, and a <em>3450mAh battery</em>. Phew, now that we got that out of the way, what does it all mean?</p>

<p>RAM allows you to multitask. Switching from app to app without any lag. 4GB is a hefty amount for any phone, and the Pixel puts it to good use. Apps open instantanously, switching from apps has close to zero lag. Picking up my 6P again and opening something like Twitter made me feel like it was a lifetime of waiting. Expect to be spoiled by how performant this phone is.</p>

<h2 id="storage">Storage</h2>
<p>The Pixel comes in 32GB and 128GB variants. I opted for the 32GB. I’ve never had an issue with storage, and the bonus to the Pixel is the unlimited Google Photo storage, at full-res. Meaning after 100+ photos, I can just delete them from my device, and everything is stored in the cloud, freeing up some space. I have about 5-6 playlists synced in Spotify, maybe 50 or so photos sitting on my phone at any time. All with plenty of space left for whatever else I may need to load onto the phone.</p>

<h2 id="battery-life">Battery Life</h2>
<p>You’ll probably be charging this phone every night if you use your phone like I do. Here’s a brief run down of my average day. I spend roughly 30 mins streaming video while doing cardio, total of 2 hours between the gym and commuting for streaming music. Littered throughout the day are checks to Instagram, Twitter(used to), Reddit, Snapchat, basically all your soul sucking social stuff. I’d end the day with roughly 5-6 hours of screen time, anywhere from 25-50% screen brightness. By the time I go to bed, around 9pm to 10pm, I’m still around 20-25% charge.</p>

<h2 id="os--bonuses">OS &amp; Bonuses</h2>
<p>THe Pixel comes with Google’s slight reworking of Android 7.1 Nougat. There are a few items that are exclusive to the Pixel. So if you’re a fan of being on the latest and greatest Android version then the Pixel is perfect for you. Pixel launcher is the new “homescreen” for the device. Swiping up from the bottom row of apps pulls up the app drawer. New icons, and the date, time, weather are all presented on the homescreen. Touch latency has seen a lot of improvement. The biggest gripe I had and a lot of people had with Android is that you would scroll through a list, place your finger on the screen to stop it, and it would take a few milliseconds for the screen to respond. This has luckily been worked on and improved greatly.</p>

<p>My favorite bonus though, comes with the addition of free full resolution backups to Google Photos. No more worrying about running out of storage for all of your photos, or selecting only your favorite ones to store at full res.</p>

<h2 id="camera">Camera</h2>
<p>What’s there to say about this camera that I’m sure you haven’t read or heard? It’s my favorite camera on an Android phone right now. Samsung offers some great features to go with their camera, but if you wanted the stock experience the Pixel offers the best point and shoot camera. Honestly though, you won’t be disappointed in a camera offered by the big three right now. Google, Apple and Samsung all offer great cameras on their phones, and a lot of it comes down to preference as far as color temperature. But what does that matter when you apply those hideous Instagram filters anyways?</p>
