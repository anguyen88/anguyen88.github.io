		<p>The current Tradeking mobile app for Android has a design style that reflects Android Froyo (2.2). I've always had an interest in stocks and finances and when I decided to start trading and learning about the market I landed on using Tradeking as my brokerage of choice. The biggest downside was always having to use their mobile app when I was on the go. I updated their app with more of a Google Material design style and blocking off important parts into separate cards. </p>
