		<p class="project-description"><strong>Goal</strong>: The homepage was taking up to 6-7 seconds to load on enterprise-level internet speeds, and homepages sometimes topped out at 24+MB, this would never work for users across the world on mobile devices.</p>
	<p class="project-description padding-bottom"><strong>Solve</strong>: We set a budget for the homepage and incorporated an optimization + minification process to the graphic design team's workflow. These changes gave us a huge performance gain, we were able to take homepages down to nearly a sub 1 second page load time along with reducing homepages down to roughly 1-3MB. This number is allowed to fluctuate to take care of any business needs.</p>
