		<p>The Free People mobile app had to be updated to go along with the new <a href="/freepeople-site">Free People Site</a> for the overall replatform goal. As the team went through marketing and product needs, we realized that a complete overhaul was necessary. The first steps were to refine the shop process that the customer would go through when opening the app.</p>

		<p class="project-description"><strong>Goal</strong>: After going through the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/Bars.html" target="_blank">iOS Human Interface Guidelines</a> the team realized that the tab bar is the navigation structure that Apple apps are headed towards. How could we present the navigation in a way that wasn't the traditional side navigation structure?</p>
		<p class="project-description padding-bottom"><strong>Solve</strong>: We decided it would be cool to do a dropdown menu that would let you dig one level deeper. Once you select a category you're pushed to a deeper category level page that lets you dig into a sub category. This reflects the site navigation and allows users to quickly jump from one subcategory to the next.</p>

		<p class="project-description"><strong>Goal</strong>: Allow filtering and searching directly from a browse level page.</p>
		<p class="project-description padding-bottom"><strong>Solve</strong>: Influenced by other e-commerce and the legacy FP app, we decided on using the filter button next to the centered navigation bar to balance out the search icon. The filter and sort system would slide in and sit over the page.</p>

		<p class="project-description"><strong>Goal</strong>: Present facets clearly to users and make it easy to decide on color, sizing, and other information needed for adding to bag.</p>
		<p class="project-description padding-bottom"><strong>Solve</strong>: We kept a lot of the skeleton from the legacy app. The sizing and touch areas for the sizing and colors all had to be bumped up to align with the iOS guidelines. We also surfaced review rating and a quick way to tap to reviews. Product images are contained in a carousel that open a zoom window upon tap. Any additional sizing requirements are surfaced to the customer when necessary or else they are hidden to avoid confusion in the buying process.</p>
