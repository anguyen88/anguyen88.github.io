###Your portfolio is a reflection of you.

Every choice you make as far as typography, colors, hover effects, etc. Every single one of those elements speaks to your identity as a designer. If that's the case then my portfolio shows my sheer passion for the development and design world. Work samples aside, my site has become a playground of sorts for me to test out my coding ability.

I set myself up for an all-nighter session to revamp my entire site and clean up my previous code as well as implement some new code. I've been using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) as the backbone to my site and I'm constantly learning how to automate as much as I can through the use of custom variables. Along with that I started to learn how to incorporate things like [GruntJS](http://gruntjs.com/) into my process to help me automate tasks like sass conversion and image compression.

Your site should be your playground. Don't be scared to break things in order to learn how to put it back together. Running Jekyll, Wordpress, Ghost, or any other CMS locally helps you see changes as you work instead of pushing errors out to a live site. You have every single chance to try ti implement whatever you want before having to push it live. See a new hover effect you like? Try to recreate it in code without looking for any references. Doing this alone as helped me understand animations so much more.

If anything, 2014 has further reinforced in me that I am never sure of anything I do. Not because I don't believe in myself, but because I constantly want to learn more and push things further. I noticed this the moment I started to learn to prototype through Zurb Foundation. From there I fell down the rabbit hole of front-end development. I started to devour code and wanted to see how everything worked on websites I frequented every day.

That's why I call my site my playground. I'm able to try new things I see that I like. Yeah, sometimes they'll break my site. Sometimes they don't look good. But that's what the web is, it is constantly changing and evolving. And that's what I want my site to be a way to gauge my progression as I evolve with it.
