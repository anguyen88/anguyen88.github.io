<sub>Full disclosure: I've used The Samsung Galaxy S2 & S3, iPhone edge, iPhone 4 â€“ iPhone 6S, Nexus 5, Nexus 6P. Daily driver currently is the Google Pixel XL for personal use and the iPhone 6S for work.</sub>

## Overall
Oh the Google Pixel. I was perfectly okay with skipping out on this generation of Google's phone. The Nexus 6P covered everything I needed in a phone and a bit more. But after spending roughly a month with the Pixel, the quality of life changes it brings absolutely puts every other Android phone that I've ever owned or tested to shame.

Not all is good though, I have to say the two biggest problems I have with this phone are price point, and the fairly bland uninspired design. The Pixel 32GB starts at $649.00, Pixel XL 32GB starts at $769.00. For a phone that starts at this price you would expect a few features that have become somewhat standard in competitor devices. Water proof, wireless charging, expandable storage.

## Performance
I tend to laugh every time a keynote speaker says "this is our best, fastest phone yet." Obviously it's going to be better than last generation right? Let's take a second and run through the tech jargon. The Pixel XL houses a _1.6GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 821_, _4GB of RAM_, and a _3450mAh battery_. Phew, now that we got that out of the way, what does it all mean?

RAM allows you to multitask. Switching from app to app without any lag. 4GB is a hefty amount for a phone. 

## Battery Life
You'll probably be charging this phone every night if you use your phone like I do. Here's a brief run down of my average day. I spend roughly 30 mins streaming video while doing cardio, total of 2 hours between the gym and commuting for streaming music. Littered throughout the day are checks to Instagram, Twitter(used to), Reddit, Snapchat, basically all your soul sucking social stuff. I'd end the day with roughly 5-6 hours of screen time, anywhere from 25-50% screen brightness. By the time I go to bed, around 9pm to 10pm, I'm still around 20-25% charge.
