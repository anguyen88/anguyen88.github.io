The TCM Film Festival is an annual event that takes place in Hollywood, CA. This project involved working with assets from various movies to concept, design and execute the key art for the years event. iOS native app was designed and built in house to align with the content that was on the website. Allowing people to set up their own schedules and view what movies were being shown around them as they were on the move.

Done while working at [1 Trick Pony](http://1trickpony.com/).
