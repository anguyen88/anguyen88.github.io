ROAR for Good is focused on developing self-defense wearable technology that diminishes attacks against women and address the underlying sources of violence.

Their first product, <a href="http://www.roarforgood.com" target="_blank">Athena</a>, is fashionable jewelry that emits a loud alarm, messages loved ones with your location, and calls the authorities for immediate help. The goal of the product is to empower women and reduce the number of assaults.
