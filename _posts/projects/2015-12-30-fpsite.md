	<h3>Project Goals</h3>
	<p>The goal of the replatform project was to make the Free People site responsive allowing us to deliver the same shopping experience from mobile through desktop.</p>

	<h3>Business Goals</h3>
	<p>The design team worked with the marketing and merchandising teams to pinpoint business goals. This allowed us to pinpoint specific features that were necessary for launch and what features we could push to the backlog for future implementation.</p>
	<p>One of the launch goals was having the homepage use live web type rather than having text built into the imagery. This helped reduce the amount of assets being produced and maintained and allowed all text to be readable on every device.</p>

	<h3>Product Browse Pages</h3>
	<p>The goal of the browse page was to find a way to quickly load products without having to make a large amount of calls to the server. Color swatches and information that wasn't essential were all hidden behind a hover effect, lessening the iniital amount of data loaded.</p>
