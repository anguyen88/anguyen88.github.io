Mobile app design for <a href="http://www.urbanoutfitters.com" target="_blank">Urban Outfitters</a>. Goals were to boost conversion and also increase number of loyalty users through a new loyalty program called MY UO. The app would track your purchases and award badges for certain events like visiting a store multiple times, buying a shoe during a promotional period and reward users with various promotions.
